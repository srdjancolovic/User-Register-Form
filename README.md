# User-Register-Form

https://userregisterform.netlify.app/

This is project made as a practice project with forms. It has two pages. In this project there are different states of input fields. Default state is without label and any placeholder value. Then there are success and error state while we are typing and they switch depending on condition we gave in validation. Also there is active stave which apperas only when we click on input field and filled state which is shown when we remove focus from our input field.
Form is fully responsive and divided into separate components so it is easy to modify.

Date of production: October 2021
